# FULLSTACKNEST
The main aim of FullStackNest is to offer a practical template for building and deploying MERN projects. It provides core features like user authentication, dynamic routing, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources such as notes or tasks. User authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and password hashing.
